oEmbed
======

oEmbed is a CKEditor plugin that allows you to insert embedded content (such as
photos, video, audio, etc.) via an external URL. For example, you can embed a
YouTube video into your content simply by pasting in the URL to the video. The
same goes for Flickr photos, Soundcloud audio, and much more!

This module provides a very simple integration between CKEditor's '[Media
(oEmbed) Plugin](https://ckeditor.com/addon/oembed)' and Backdrop.

NOTE: This module will automatically add `<iframe>` and `<div>` tags to the list
of 'Allowed HTML Tags' for any text format it's enabled on.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

- Visit the 'Text editors and formats' page under Administration >
  Configuration > Content authoring > Text editors and formats
  (admin/config/content/formats) and configure a CKEditor-enabled text editor to
  add the 'oEmbed' button.
